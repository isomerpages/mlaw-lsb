PROFESSIONAL INTERVIEW
---

All applicants are required to attend a professional interview. Each applicant will be interviewed by a panel made up of the Board members. At the interview, the panel will probe the applicantsâ€™ knowledge and experience as recorded in the application forms. The applicants will be expected to comment upon any aspect of the surveying practice which the panel may raise and to show an awareness of current issues on practice and the survey profession.
