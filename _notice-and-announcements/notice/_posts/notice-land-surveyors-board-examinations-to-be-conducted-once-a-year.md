NOTICE: LAND SURVEYORS BOARD EXAMINATIONS TO BE CONDUCTED ONCE A YEAR

Our Ref : LSB 112<br>
TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN<br>
Dear Sirs / Madams

**LSB NOTICE: LAND SURVEYORS BOARD EXAMINATIONS TO BE CONDUCTED ONCE A YEAR**

1. The Land Surveyors Act requires every practicing land surveyor, and not only land surveyors who conduct cadastral surveys, to be registered with the Board. Those who have been providing survey services other than cadastral surveys were allowed to practice for 4 years with effect from 1 Mar 2000 under S(10) of the Land Surveyors (Amendment) Act. On expiry of the transitional period of 4 years, a further period not exceeding 2 years were granted by the Minister on a case-by-case basis. The 4+2 years grace period would enable persons affected by the provision to sit and pass the examinations for registration with the Board. For this reason, the Board has been conducting examinations twice a year.

2. As the 4+2 years transitional period expires on 28 Feb 2006, the Board would revert to conducting the examinations once a year. We would inform you of the date of the examination 3 months from its commencement and would also post this notification in the Board's website.

Yours faithfully,
