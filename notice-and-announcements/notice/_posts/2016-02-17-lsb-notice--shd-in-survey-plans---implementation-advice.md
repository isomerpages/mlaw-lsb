**LSB NOTICE ON SINGAPORE HEIGHT DATUM (SHD) IN SURVEY PLANS – IMPLEMENTATION ADVICE**<br>

To Registered Surveyors (RS),<br>

The Land Surveyors Board (LSB) had recently sent a notice on the above to the relevant agencies/authorities on the adoption of SHD.<br>

{:start="2"} 
2. A copy of the LSB Notice is attached for your information.<br>

3. Whilst LSB do anticipate that the notice may not be complied with at times i.e. the false datum of +100m still being used in the contract specifications, it will be good that RSs:<br>

(i) Advise the Agencies’ Superintending Officer (SO) on the SHD and the LSB Notice;<br>

(ii) Get the SOs confirmation if the false datum of +100m is to be adopted.<br>
{:start="4"} 
4. Please note that LSB is not expecting RSs to be policing the subject matter but to help raise the awareness amongst the calling agencies and to respond professionally i.e. alerting / advising the SOs on the subject matter above. It is for the SOs to decide on their requirements after RSs have done their due diligence in advising the SOs.<br> 

5. The Board looks forward to your participation and contribution to bring our industry forward.<br>

6. Thank you.<br>

Yours sincerely,

Richard Ho<br>
Registrar<br>
LAND SURVEYORS BOARD<br>

 **LSB NOTICE ON SINGAPORE HEIGHT DATUM (SHD) IN SURVEY PLANS – IMPLEMENTATION ADVICE**

TO AGENCIES IN CC LIST 

Dear Sir,<br>

The subject matter refers.<br>

{:start="2"} 
2. The following notice issued by the Land Surveyors Board (LSB) is to ensure that all survey plans submitted to Agencies are based on the Singapore Height Datum (SHD) of 0.000m where measurements of vertical distances are concerned.<br>

3. This is to address topographical, engineering and building contracts currently specifying the use of false datum of +100m (also known as ‘PWD Datum’).<br>

4. With the introduction of SHD, it should be adopted for all new contracts henceforth where heights are concerned since the use of false datum of +100m may cause confusion due to the underground levels where parts of it may exceed 100m below SHD. In addition, using only one and true datum (SHD) will avert undue complications with the implementation of Building Information Modelling (BIM). Hence, LSB advocates that the industry should adopt only one datum i.e. SHD = 0.000m across the agencies.<br>

5. In this regard, LSB would also like to draw your attention to Chief Surveyor’s Circular 2/2015 on SHD in Survey Plans and the requirements for all jobs submitted to Chief Surveyor w.e.f. 15th June 2015. For easy reference, a copy of the circular with the relevant Annex is enclosed with this notice. The circular is also published in SLA’s website video:<br>
[http://www.sla.gov.sg/Pressroom/Circulars/LandSurvey.aspx](http://www.sla.gov.sg/Pressroom/Circulars/LandSurvey.aspx)<br>

6. I would appreciate it if you can communicate this advisory to the relevant section in your agency.<br>

Yours sincerely,<br>
