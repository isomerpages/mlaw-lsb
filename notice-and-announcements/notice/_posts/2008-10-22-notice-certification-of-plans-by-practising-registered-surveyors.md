1. It has been brought to the Board's attention that some Registered Surveyors may be certifying plans that are not prepared by them which may inadvertently constitute contravention of the Land Surveyors Act.

2. Under the Act, only Registered Surveyors who has in force a practising certificate may certify to the correctness or accuracy of any survey. The Act has provisions concerning the manner Registered Surveyors may certify plans and prohibitions against persons who are not authorised to supply or offer survey services in Singapore. The Board would like to reiterate that a practising registered surveyor contravenes these provisions by signing on any plan, calculation, sketches and other related documents of any survey not prepared or conducted by him or under his immediate supervision.

3. The Board would like to receive information concerning Registered Surveyors who may have contravened the Land Surveyors Act, in particular in the above-mentioned areas and will not hesitate to take firm action against those who commit such improper acts.

Yours faithfully
