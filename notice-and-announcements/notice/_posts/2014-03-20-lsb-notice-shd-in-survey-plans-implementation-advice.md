**LSB NOTICE: REQUIREMENT OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY** <br>
**FOR LAND SURVEYORS BOARD PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE EXAMINATIONS** <br>

 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among its various functions, Land Surveyors Board holds examinations to enable suitably qualified candidates to be registered under section 12(1)(a) of the Land Surveyors Act. The professional practice examinations are conducted in English.

 

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Candidates whose language of instruction for their professional degree is not English or whose degree has not been taught entirely in English are required to provide evidence of their English language ability before they register in order to be confident that they can participate optimally in the examinations.

 

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For candidates who fall under this category, we require you to take the following Aptis test conducted by the British Council. The Registration Form can be downloaded from Land Surveyors Board website. Once Land Surveyors Board receives the completed form, we will forward to British Council. For more information on the test and its registration process, visit the British Council Aptis website at [http://www.britishcouncil.org.sg/aptis](http://www.britishcouncil.org.sg/aptis)
