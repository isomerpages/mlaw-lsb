## HISTORY OF LAND SURVEYORS BOARD

The Land Surveyors Act was enacted to provide a system of registration of surveyors to meet the demand for cadastral surveys in Singapore. Since the Act came into operation on 1 September 1972, registered surveyors are allowed to undertake cadastral surveys which before could only be carried out by the Chief Surveyor.

The Act aims to protect the public by ensuring survey services are provided by registered surveyors in a professional and competent manner, and to uphold the standards of practice of registered surveyors. These objectives were achieved through the establishment of the Land Surveyors Board (LSB) which is responsible for the registration and regulation of surveyors. 

Over the years, development projects became bigger and more complex. These projects required integrated design inputs from a team of allied professionals - land surveyors, architects and engineers. In this light, LSB continuously amends the provisions of the Act to help registered surveyors perform a multi-disciplinary practice with allied professionals.
