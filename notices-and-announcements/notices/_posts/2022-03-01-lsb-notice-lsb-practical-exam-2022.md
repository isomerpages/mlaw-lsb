**B. Changes to Examination**

2\. The LSB has reviewed “LSB Notice – Land Surveyors Board Examinations to be held on Friday, 2 August 2013” and is pleased to inform that the requirement stated therein for a person to pass the cadastral law written examination before attempting the land lot and/or strata survey subjects is now removed. Eligible persons may apply to take the oral and practical examination without first passing the cadastral law written examination with immediate effect.

3\. A new examination format is now being introduced and a briefing session was held on 16 December 2021 by the Examination Committee to interested participants. I would like to bring your attention to the documents attached: 1) Instructions to Candidate (together with Annexes C and D) and 2) List of sites not to be selected. All candidates must familiarise themselves with the requirements and format of the examination stated therein for compliance. Attachments enclosed:
