**Changes to Practical Examinations**

2\. LSB has reviewed “LSB Notice – Land Surveyors Board Examinations to be held on Friday, 2 August 2013” and is pleased to inform that the requirement stated therein for a candidate to pass the cadastral law written examination before taking the land lot and/or strata survey subjects in the practical examinations is now removed. Candidates can apply and attempt the oral and practical examinations without first passing the cadastral law written examination with immediate effect.

3\. A new examination format is now being introduced and a briefing session was held on 16 December 2021 by the Examination Committee to interested participants. I would like to bring your attention to the documents attached: 1) Instructions to Candidate (together with Annexes C and D) and 2) List of sites not to be selected. All candidates are to familiarise themselves with the requirements and format of the examinations stated therein for compliance. Attachments enclosed:

To protect candidates and members of the public, all candidates and their assistants shall adhere strictly to the prevailing safe management measures stipulated by the government/relevant authorities at all times with regards to COVID-19 during the course of the practical examination. In addition, the following guidelines shall be adhered to at all times during the period of the practical examination:<br>
