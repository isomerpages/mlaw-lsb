## LSB NOTICE: CONTINUING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT (CPD) REQUIREMENTS FOR PRACTICE IN YEAR 2022


03 March 2021


**LSB NOTICE: CONTINUING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT (CPD) REQUIREMENTS FOR PRACTICE IN YEAR 2022** <br>


  1. As Singapore has now moved into Phase 3 of re-opening, the Land Surveyors Board (LSB) would like to update the fraternity on the CPD requirements for the renewal of Practicing Certificate (PC) for practice in Year 2022 (PC 2022).

2. To remind ourselves, the LSB had announced in April 2020 a one-off special waiver of the CPD requirement for practice in 2021. Back then, the LSB had granted that CPD units accumulated by registered surveyors (RS) previously after renewal for PC 2020 and CPD units acquired in year 2020 (up to maximum of 20 CPD units combined) to be recognised and brought forward for PC 2022 renewal. With this, the LSB is glad to announce that all RS who made an application in 2020 for renewal of their PC were all issued with a PC which allows them to practise this year.

3. As part of LSB's continued efforts to support our fellow RS during this period, the LSB would like to announce that the CPD requirements for PC 2022 will be halved, that is, **<u>10 CPD units is required for PC 2022</u>**. However, those of you who have a shortfall of CPD units previously will still need to make up the CPD units on top of this 10 CPD units for the renewal of PC 2022.

4. CPD units earned before 2021 and carried forward into 2021 for PC 2022 renewal as explained in para 2 shall not be carried forward to 2022. Only unused excess of CPD units earned in 2021 (up to a maximum 20 CPD units) will be allowed to carry forward into 2022 for the renewal of practicing certificate for practice in Year 2023.

5. The LSB would like to encourage all RS to participate in online e-learning/webinars to enrich their professional development during this period and garner sufficient CPD units for PC 2022. In support of this, there shall be no cap to the maximum points claimable under Activity Code C (which recognises webinars or online learning) in the Guildelines for CPD Claimable Units in 2021.

**Example 1**

RS A has 15 unused excess CPD units earned in 2019 (after accounting for 20 CPD units required for renewal of PC2020) and 10 CPD units earned in 2020. He carries forward 20 CPD units into 2021 and has earned 25 CPD units in 2021. The carried forward of 20 CPD units can be used for PC2022 but the excess of 10 CPD units from this carried-forward will not be allowed to be carried forward into 2022. Only up to the maximum of unused excess CPD units (which in this case will be 20 CPD units) he earned in 2021 will be allowed to be carried forward into 2022.

**Example 2**

RS B has 5 unused excess CPD units earned in 2019 (after accounting for 20 CPD units required for renewal of PC2020) and 2 CPD units earned in 2020. He carries forward 7 CPD units into 2021 and earned 10 CPD units in 2021. The carried forward of 7 CPD units can be used for PC2022 but he still needs 3 more CPD units, which will be used/deducted from the 10 CPD units earned in 2021. As such, there will be 7 unused excess CPD unit earned in 2021 which will be allowed to be carried forward into 2022.
