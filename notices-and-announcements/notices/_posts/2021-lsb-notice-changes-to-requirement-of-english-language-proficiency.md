## LSB NOTICE: CHANGES TO REQUIREMENT OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY

1 March 2021


**LSB NOTICE: CHANGES TO REQUIREMENT OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY** <br>
**FOR LAND SURVEYORS BOARD PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE EXAMINATIONS**

1.  In the LSB Notice dated 20 March 2014, the Land Surveyors Board (the "Board") provided the requirements for candidates whose language of instructions for their professional degree is not in English or whose degree has not been taught entirely in English to take and pass the APTIS test before taking the Board's examinations.

2. The Board has conducted a review of this requirement and is pleased to announce that the requirement of the APTIS test is no longer necessary. With this change, candidates having a degree with professional examinations recognised by the Board will be allowed to apply and take the Board's examinaation without the need of the APTIS test requirement.
  
3. The Board has made this decision after considering the multiple checkpoints in the form of the written and practical examinations s well as the professional interview. The Board is confident tht the removal of the APTIS test will not compromise on the quality of candidates who will go on to becomea registered surveyor after meeting the requirements for registration.

4. The Board will monitor the situation closely and may conduct a separate interview for the purpose of determining the proficiency of a candidate in the English Language. The Board may also introduce other measures or re-introduce the English proficiency test in future to maintain the standards of surveyors registered with the Board in Singapore.

5. This Notice takes immediate effect.
