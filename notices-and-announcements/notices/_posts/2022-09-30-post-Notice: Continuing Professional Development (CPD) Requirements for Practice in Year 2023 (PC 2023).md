#### **LSB NOTICE: CONTINUING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT (CPD) REQUIREMENTS FOR PRACTICE IN YEAR 2023 (PC 2023)**

1. While recovering from COVID-19 restrictions in 2021, the Land Surveyors Board (LSB) had informed the fraternity on 3 March 2021 that the CPD requirments for the renewal of Practicing Certificate (PC) in Year 2022 (PC 2022) will be halved, or 10 CPD units is required for renewal of PC 2022.<br>




2. As we resume economic and social activities in a safe manner through post-COVID-19 adaptions and the gradual shift towards online learning, LSB would like to extend further support towards fellow Registered Surveyors (RS) this year by extending the **lifting of cap in Category C for PC 2023**, which includes online e-learning/webinars. In other words, there shall be no cap imposed in Category C for PC 2023 renewal.<br>




3.  However, fellow RS will still require a minimum of 20 CPD units for PC 2023 renewal and those who have a shortfall of CPD units previously will still need to make-up for the lack of CPD units for PC 2023 renewal.<br>





4. LSB would like to encourage all fellow RS to participate in all manners of conferences or seminars, be it physical or online, to continually enrich their professional development to obtain sufficient CPD units for PC 2023.<br>
