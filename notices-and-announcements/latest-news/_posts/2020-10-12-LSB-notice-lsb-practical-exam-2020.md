## LSB NOTICE: UPDATE: LAND SURVEYORS BOARD (LSB) PRACTICAL EXAMINATIONS IN LAND LOT AND STRATA SURVEY FOR 2020

**LSB NOTICE: UPDATE: LAND SURVEYORS BOARD (LSB) PRACTICAL EXAMINATIONS IN LAND LOT AND STRATA SURVEY FOR 2020**

1. Under the Land Surveyors Rules, examinations conducted by the Board for the purpose of Section 12(1)(a) of the Land Surveyors Act shall be held at least once a year.

2. The Board has successfully conducted the Cadastral Law Written Examination on 14 Sep 2020 with social distancing protocols implemented in examination location.

3. During the conduct of the LSB Practical Examinations in Land Lot and Strata Survey, candidates are expected to do a physical survey, which requires access to sites under survey and involve interactions with residents/shop owners/shop assistants during the course of survey. The LSB understands that it is extremely difficult for candiates to adhere to mandated safe distancing requirements when out doing field work in such an environment. Shop owners in particular wIll be weary of presence of the Survey team in their premises affecting their ability to implement safe management measures and may refuse access to candidates.

4. The LSB has been monitoring the Covid-19 situation and will not risk the health and safety of candidates, our fellow Singaporeans and residents. At this juncture, there is no assurance that the Practial Examinations can be conducted safely with strict compliance to safe distancing measures.

5. As it stands, the LSB has decided that the LSB Practical and Oral Examinations in Land Lot and Strata Survey for 2020 will not be held. However, the LSB will keep monitoring the situation as to the suitability of holding the examination at an appropriate time.
