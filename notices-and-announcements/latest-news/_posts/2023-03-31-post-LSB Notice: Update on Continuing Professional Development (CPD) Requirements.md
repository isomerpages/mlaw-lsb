#### LSB NOTICE: CONTINUING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT (CPD) REQUIREMENTS 

1. The Land Surveyors Board (LSB) would like to announce the resumption of all CPD requirements starting with the renewal of practising certificate in year 2024 (PC 2024) and at the same time to resume **the cap in Category C**, which includes online e-learning/webinars. Category C will be capped at a maximum 10 CPD units for PC 2024 renewal and beyond.<br>


2. There is no change to obtain a minimum of 20 CPD units for PC2024 renewal and those who have a shortfall of CPD units previously will still need to make-up for the lack of CPD units during PC 2024 renewal.<br>


3.  LSB would like to encourage all practising registered surveyors to constantly enrich their professional development to obtain sufficient CPD units for PC 2024.<br>
