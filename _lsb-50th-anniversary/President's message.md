The year 2022 marks the Golden Jubilee of Land Surveyors Board. This is also a very special year as the world continues to grapple with an unprecedented global health crisis. While we take some time off to celebrate, it is still important for us to reflect on the past, and more importantly, to focus on the future.

Land Surveyors Board was set up 50 years ago after the Land Surveyors Act came into operation on 1 September 1972.

Over 50 years, we have come a long way, moving from chain surveying to modern laser technique in data acquisition, but land surveying technology continues to evolve. As with every industry, the future of land surveying is set to change in the coming years. With changes in data management, an increase in drone usage, and improvements in mobile 3D mapping, surveying can expect many developments ahead of it. Moving trends have significant implications for our industry that can improve data collection, change data storage approaches and offer more accessible and flexible information gathering. With LSB, trends start here. To resonate with our new generation of surveyors, LSB has recently joined in the fun with Tik Tok. This video platform will allow young people to hear all about what makes our profession so fun and rewarding.

This year, LSB has planned a year-long exciting program of celebratory events. The 50th anniversary celebrations are an opportunity for the Board to reconnect with all its professionals. To mark an important milestone for this Golden Jubilee, LSB has designed a logo to commemorate this occasion.

In appreciation of your part in the past and present nation-building of Singapore, LSB will host a get-together dinner on the house for registered surveyors. We are excited to catch up with you all at these events and more details will be published via this webpage over the coming year.

Stay safe and I hope to see you soon.
